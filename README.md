## Keep your Resources Fresh

`NSBundle+LiveBundle` is a category which provides dynamic updating of resources from your web server.

Let's say you have a resource, any resource will do, but for e.g. a plist which contains a list of your companies
products, their prices, and links to purchase them; which is stored inside MyApplication's bundle as a resource:

    MyApplication.app/Contents/Resources/productTable.plist

And let's say you want to add a new product, or change a price for asale, or update a link, but don't want to
release a new version of your app or write a web server that hosts an API or the code to support it?

LiveBundle provides infrastructure for hosting bundle resources on your web server at a URL that you specify,
so that your app can check to see if there is an updated version of the resource avaliable for download:

    https://exaple.com/support/livebundle/com.example.myapplication/productsTable.plist

LiveBundle makes a If-Modified-Since request to your server when the resource is requested. It
then downloads the resource, and copies it into the users's Library folder (or it's sandboxed equivalent):

    ~/Library/Application Support/MyApplication/LiveBundle/com.example.myapplication/products_table.plist

And that's the path that your code sees when it asks for the resource:

    NSString* livePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] livePathForResource:@"productsTable" ofType:@"plist"];
    NSDictionary* productsTable = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:livePath];

    // Subscribe to be notified for updates to the file path (or just watch the file path yourelf):

    [NSNotificationCenter。defaultCenter 
        addObserverForName:ILLiveBundleResourceUpdateNote 
        object:livePth 
        queue:nil 
        usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {
            productsTable = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:livePath];
            // update the ui...
        }];

The initial path is a link back to the resource in the application's bundle, once an updated version
has been sucesfully downloaded the notificaion will be sent to the application. Send `object:nil` to
recieve notifications for all LiveBundle Resource Updates.

This works well for data that changes on a weekly or monthly basis, the app should only check a URL
once per launch, or as much as daily if it's running for a long time.

## Using LiveBundle in your App

- Clone the latest sources: `git clone https://github.com/iStumblerLabs/LiveBundle.git` 
  near or inside your application's source 
- Drag `LiveBundle.xcodproj` into your project
- include the `LiveBundle.framework` in your applications `Resources/Frameworks` directory
    - link the `LiveBundle.framework` to all the targets which produce bundles you would like to update

## Swift Package <a id="spm"></a>

A Swift Package is defined in `Package.swift` for projects using Swift Package Manager, 
you can include the following URL in your project to use it:

    https://github.com/iStumblerLabs/LiveBundle.git

## Configure LiveBundle

- add a key to the `Info.plist` of all the `NSBundle`s you want to update pionting to the web server
    - `ILLiveBundleURLKey` is the base url for the bundles resources
        - e.g. `https://example.com/livebundle/`
    - when calling `livePathForResource:` the URL is prepended to the resource requested
        - e.g. `livePathForResource:@"resource.plist"` is `https://example.com/livebundle/resource.plist`
- add a UI element to disable LiveBundle if the user doesn't want updates:
    - bind the element's value to the `NSUserDefaults` key: `ILLiveBundleDisableUpdates`
    - checkboxes work well if you use `NSNegateBoolean` with the phrase `Automatically Update Resources on Startup`
    - it will be selected by default, and the user disabling will set the value to YES
- deploy resources to your web server and always test before you ship!
